Welcome to SpaceShare!

SpaceShare is becoming a mobile application that will help therapists to maximize their office space.  With SpaceShare, therapists can easily rent out their office space whenever they are not using it. Likewise, SpaceShare makes it easy for therapists to pick up office space day to day, as needed.

SpaceShare strives to create a transparent and respectful private-office networking system. Our platform will include user profiles, images and detailed listings of each space within an area of interest. User rating systems and badges will ensure accountability and cleanliness between users. These feedback systems will allow users to rate and review each other in regards to the quality of their transaction, ensuring security while SpaceSharing.

SpaceShare provides a market for immediate and flexible office space. Connecting the Space Havers with the Space Needers.

SpaceShare offers opportunities for fee discounts through Early Adopters and referrals.  Become an Early Adopter and receive discounts on your transaction fees. Refer friends to SpaceShare and you will both receive discounts!
